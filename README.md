# Photo-Manager
Python Photo Manager final project for CIS 115 (Fall 2015)
Photo Manager is a personal project by myself (Joshua Hutchins) to submit as a final project for CIS-115 Introduction to Programming and logic at GTCC.

The main goal of the application was to rename all the photos in a folder with a string (say, the event at which you took them) and a number, which represents the order in which the photos were taken.

Before submission near the beginning of December 2015, I hope to have:
-A complete GUI using tkInter.
-The ability to view the images right in the application.
-The ability to rotate a specific image.
-The ability to rename the photos in the inverse order.
